# MovieQu
A sample Android movie database application built for my learning journey to explore and catch up with modern Android development technologies, specifically **Jetpack Compose**.

## Purpose

This project was created as a learning exercise to:

- Get hands-on experience with **Jetpack Compose** - Android's modern UI toolkit
- Explore modern Android development patterns and best practices
- Integrate various popular libraries commonly used in professional Android development
- Practice implementing MVVM architecture with reactive programming

**Taking it to the Next Level:**

This project represents the next step in my **Jetpack Compose** learning journey. While my previous Weather App project used Jetpack Compose for only a single screen without navigation, MovieQu is designed to implement **full app navigation with multiple screens and multiple features**.

This allows me to explore:

- **Jetpack Navigation Compose** - Modern navigation between multiple screens
- **Complex UI state management** across different screens
- **Feature-based architecture** with multiple interconnected modules
- **Advanced Compose patterns** for larger, more realistic applications

## Features
_Features will be added soon_

## Technologies & Libraries Used
#### UI Framework
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces
#### Architecture & Design Pattern

- **LiveData** - Observable data holder for lifecycle-aware UI updates
#### Networking & Data Handling
- **Retrofit** - Type-safe HTTP client for consuming REST APIs
- **Moshi** - Modern JSON parsing library for Kotlin
#### Reactive Programming
- **RxJava** - Reactive extensions for composable asynchronous programming
#### Dependency Injection
